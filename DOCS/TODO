#Things in mind, volunteers/suggestions are welcome:

  HOT:
      
  OTHER STUFF:
  Code cleanup/optimizing (i was too paranoid ad checks maybe)/Mojolicious::Guides::CodingGuidelines 
  Since NCMS is young, we take 6 month since 1th may to make all mods @core and freeze it.
  Think about more transparent route('/some/:c/:a/param)->to route decoration
  Make everythin as plugins, aso separate parts (at least routes) - adm/content side? [maaaaybe]
  global %MULTISESSION{'SITE'}{'SOMEKEYS'} feature - static ocnnections to DB/MEMD/etc
  Update templates use css styles from smth popular like wordpress/joomla (!)
  breadcrumbs
  Improve texts/localization (ready lang files, error messages, etc)
  Access permissions for Menus (like @ pages, ' "visible for" option ')
  Access/Post permissions for Categoryes (-//-)
  System variables @ DB feature (except database itself :) - init, load params from db, update keys, continue)
  Comments system, 
  Comments as forum thread option 
  Tag clouds system
  "Contact us" customizeble form
  Subscribe system
  RSS core (global) + extensions (content complete/per category, for example, it useful)
  Gallery/Image simple api (resize, add watermark)??? - for pages at least - 
    parse page on save and make correctly sized copies of images at page, 
    (if they were resized in cfeditor (big img but wth h/s = 10px or smth)), other reasons
  FAQ subsystem
  Documentation/Help
  Make a bit "useful"'er/"looks cool" "demo" site.
  WebSocket simple app. Like chat (with google chrome possible, it supports WebSocket out-of-box alredy).
  Improve templates, maybe self-made "admin theme", not critical at all, i need cms env, not a "original-designed env"
  Improve AJAX usage @ admin pages
  Extend possible databases to use: from mysql to postgress or maybe more over orm [for base admin]. At least test/fix postgress :)
  Extend/test multi site feature.
  Get rid of Date::Calc - seems like it requires half of cpan
  Shell script start/restart server for init.d, LSB compat
  Use TT cleverier
  robots, favicon rules for nginx for multisite (map robots.domain.txt => robots.txt, etc)
  Mess with date and offsets... I've been to clever with it and lost what where alredy 
  modify content_get_catrecord like get_pagerecord: not ([], {extraparams}), but get_pagerecord: ({cat_ids=>[],extraparams})
  add all standart Mojolicious error pages  - 404, etc, since current set is done from scratch and don't have any
  ShortUrl groups should also have own alias to allow /r/grp_alias/9sd32, /r/grp_id=\d+/skyd76 now (.
  Mojolicious app log parser (at least, access, say last 1000-10000 strings) @box? Would be fun.
    btw, mess with log, now daemon itself put logs at ./, client request as defined @ cfg...
  Add actions logging and fail return conditions @ log - will it slow apps?
  @ Users, 'show extra replaces' - to control/monitor. Also, extrareplaces may should have "expire date"
  Update all JS dialogs and evrything as Mootools locales, not hash like now, 
    which was about temporary solution, before locales extension man was read )
  Update FileManager.js to use locales 
  
..not complete...
